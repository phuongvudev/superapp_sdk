# Main App Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Main App serves as the host platform for various mini applications, creating a unified ecosystem while maintaining modularity. This architecture allows for independent development of features as mini apps while providing a cohesive user experience.
The architecture is designed to support multiple platforms, including Flutter, iOS, and Android, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
The main app is responsible for core functionalities such as navigation, state management, and event communication. Mini apps can be developed in various technologies (Flutter, React Native, Web) and integrated seamlessly into the main app.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Framework

- **Core Module**: Central package managing shared functionality
- **Platform Bridge**: Native code integration for iOS and Android
- **Event Communication**: Bidirectional messaging system between main app and mini apps

### 2. App Structure

├── core/              # Core functionality and shared services
├── mini_app_host/     # Containers for mini app integration
├── navigation/        # Navigation and routing system
├── state_management/  # Global state management
├── ui_components/     # Shared UI components
└── services/          # App-wide services
```

## Communication Architecture

### Event Bus Pattern

The Event Bus forms the backbone of the communication system between the Main App and Mini Apps:

- **Bidirectional Messaging**: Events flow in both directions
- **Type-Safe Events**: Structured event types with defined schemas
- **Secure Communication**: Optional encryption for sensitive data
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Native implementation on iOS and Android

### Implementation Details

- Flutter's MethodChannel and EventChannel for native platform communication
- Broadcast streams for in-app event distribution
- Support for encrypted and unencrypted messages

## Mini App Integration

### Supported Mini App Types

- **Native Flutter**: Direct integration with shared event bus
- **WebView-Based**: Web applications with JavaScript bridge
- **React Native**: Integration via native modules and event emitters
- **Native Platform Views**: Android/iOS native views with bidirectional communication

### Mini App Lifecycle

1. Registration with the main app
2. Initialization and configuration
3. Active communication via event bus
4. Cleanup and resource release

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Platform-specific security implementations
- Validation of event data and sources

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices

- Use typed events for better compile-time safety
- Implement proper error handling for all communications
- Test cross-platform compatibility thoroughly
- Document all event types and their payload structures

### Debugging and Testing

- Enable verbose logging in development builds
- Use the visual event monitor for debugging
- Create comprehensive test events for communication paths

## Deployment Model

- Main App provides the shell and core services
- Mini Apps can be updated independently
- Configuration-driven feature flags for gradual rollouts

This architecture enables a flexible, modular approach to app development while maintaining a cohesive experience for users.
