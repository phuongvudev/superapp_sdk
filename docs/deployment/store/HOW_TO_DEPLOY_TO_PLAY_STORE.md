---

## Prerequisites
- Ensure the app is fully tested and ready for release.

## Steps for Deployment

### 1. **Prepare Your App for Release**
- Update the app version in the `build.gradle` file:
  ```gradle
  android {
      defaultConfig {
          versionCode 2 // Increment this for every release
          versionName "1.1" // Update the version name
      }
  }
  ```
- Ensure the app is signed with a release key:
   - Generate a keystore if you don’t have one:
     ```bash
     keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release-key
     ```
   - Configure the `build.gradle` file to use the keystore:
     ```gradle
     android {
         signingConfigs {
             release {
                 storeFile file("release-key.jks")
                 storePassword "your-store-password"
                 keyAlias "release-key"
                 keyPassword "your-key-password"
             }
         }
         buildTypes {
             release {
                 signingConfig signingConfigs.release
                 minifyEnabled true // Enable ProGuard for release builds
                 proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
             }
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Generate a Release Build**
- Build the signed APK or App Bundle:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew assembleRelease
  ```
- The output will be located in the `app/build/outputs` directory.
