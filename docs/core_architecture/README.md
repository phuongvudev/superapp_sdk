# SDK Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This SDK is designed to provide a modular, scalable, and cross-platform solution for integrating mini applications into a main application. It supports multiple frameworks and platforms, ensuring flexibility and ease of use for developers.

### Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Independent mini apps with seamless integration.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Android, iOS, and Web.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Structured event bus for interaction between the main app and mini apps.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and sandboxed environments.
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, caching, and efficient resource management.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Framework
- **Core Module**: Manages shared functionality and services.
- **Platform Bridge**: Facilitates communication between native code and mini apps.
- **Event Bus**: Enables bidirectional, type-safe communication.

### 2. Mini App Infrastructure
- **Registry**: Handles mini app registration and discovery. 
- **Lifecycle Management**: Manages initialization, execution, and cleanup of mini apps. 
- **State Management**: Shares data between mini apps and the main app via the event bus.

### 3. Communication System
- **Event Bus**: Centralized messaging system for secure and structured communication.
- **Service Discovery**: Allows mini apps to discover and use main app services.

## Mini App Types

1. **Flutter Mini Apps**: Direct integration with the event bus. Also, they can be loaded as widgets within the main app.
   - **Flutter Web**: Similar to Flutter mini apps but designed for web platforms. Will be loaded in a web view.
   - **React Native Mini Apps**: Integrated using a custom bridge for communication with the main app. It can be loaded in a web view or as a native module.
2. **WebView Mini Apps**: JavaScript-based apps with a JS bridge. The web view is loaded within the main app using a web view component.
3. **Native Mini Apps**: Built with Kotlin/Java (Android) or Swift (iOS).
4. **Hybrid Mini Apps**: Combines Flutter and native code.

## Development Guidelines

### Event Bus Integration
- Use structured events for communication.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging.

### State Management
- Maintain isolated state within mini apps.
- Share state only through the event bus.

### UI/UX
- Follow the main app's design system for consistency.
- Implement responsive layouts for various screen sizes.
- Use platform-specific UI components where necessary.
- Each mini app should have its own theme and styles. It should not affect the main app's theme.

---

## Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: Secure sensitive data during transmission.
- **Sandboxing**: Isolate mini apps to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: Use the main app's authentication mechanisms.

---

## Deployment and Versioning
- **Independent Deployment**: Mini apps can be updated independently.
- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure backward compatibility with the main app.
- **Lazy Loading**: Load mini apps on demand to optimize performance.

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Validate business logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Test communication with the main app.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Ensure seamless user experience.

---

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize startup time with deferred loading.
- Optimize network requests and resource usage.
- Monitor performance using built-in analytics.
